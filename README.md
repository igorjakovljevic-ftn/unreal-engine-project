# unreal-engine-project

Hey there! This is just a simple project I am making while learning about all the ins and outs of Unreal Engine. The 
focus here is primarily on learning gameplay programming using C++. Anyone can run this project at any time by downloading
Unreal Engine from the Epic Games Store (current working version is 4.27.0) and opening the .uproject file.
